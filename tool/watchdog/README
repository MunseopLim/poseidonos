ibofd - ibof watchdog daemon process

Description : the ibofd watchdog monitors whether ibofos process run or not, and start process when needs.

Options: ibofd.py allows four options for now
	-i, --inverval : monitoring interval seconds, by default 10s
	-l, --log : logfile, by default /var/log/syslog
	-d, --daemon : run ibofd as daemon(1) or process (0)
	-f, --finalize: -f 1 will terminate ibofd as well as ibofos


How to Run:
An user can install and run ibofd one of following two ways
1) Manual : run ibofd.py on your own after boot
	- Start: ibofd.py (=ibofd.py -d 1) 
	- Stop : ibofd.py -f 1

2) Manual as System Service : register ibofd as system service. Working as system service, ibofd can be controlled by service daemon
	- 1. install_ibofd.sh : register ibofd as system service
	- 2. service ibofd start | stop | restart
	- 3. uninstall_ibofd.sh : unregister ibofd from system service
	- Note1: ibofd and ibofos requires hugememory reservation and using userspace driver, which forces to detach kernel driver. 
		 As this is debatable, we determained to remain it as an user's choice. 
		 e.g) register 'service ibofd start' at bootup script such as rcS, it will make ibofos run in an autonomous way even after boot up.
	- Note2: The service script has dependency on posix distribution. current script is checked on ubuntu distro 18.04 / 19.10
